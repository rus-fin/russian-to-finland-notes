# Relocation notes

## Important

- First residence permit must be asked while residing local country (e.g. Venäjä)
- If one asks for permit being in Suomi there are range of limitations and risks (no border crossing until result, risk of getting penalties)
- It's not allowed for a specialist to work in Suomi without Residence Permit
- ~~After submitting residence permit form the worker can get initiation certificate and then ask Visa Centre for tourist visa in order to visit Suomi and meet the team~~
- Tricky but risky way of requesting first Residence Permit while being in Suomi or visiting Suomi after requesting Residence Permit with valid visa, Visa Centre and Council staff warned about it many times

## Best practices

- Find and read legal practices on the topic or find personal legal advisor/expert/lawyer
- You should have personal foreign currency bank account for incoming payments in euro or have been registered as Private Entrepreneur (or other legal entity that has a right to receive foreign incoming payments) in case of incoming payments (e.g. relocation support package or payment for remote work), don't forget to pay taxes
- Be open and talk directly with all participants whether it's CEO of the company or migrational service staff, you'll get needed information instantly: everything is changing every moment
- Pay attention to all the information you get from the internets, look for official sources only, prefer direct contact
- Ask for help instantly, don't waste time stalking around
- Reserve at least three months and appropriate amount of money for relocation process
- Start learning suomen kieli and take a look at [yle.fi](http://yle.fi) and [areena.yle.fi](http://areena.yle.fi)
- While filling the Residence Permit Form select NO for question "If you wish, your application can be shared with your employer in Enter Finland forEmployers. In this case, your employer must report the key work conditions and submit", in this case you need to upload filled TEM form, but otherwise you'll have to wait for the Company to sign in to EnterFinland and fill everything in limited time.
